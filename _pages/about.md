I am a Master's student in Robotics at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), the Netherlands. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with **Excellent Graduate Honor** from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), Shenzhen, China.

Inspired by the fantasies of Jules Verne and Isaac Asimov, I am captivated by the unparalleled elegance of robotics, which propels me to further explore robotic intelligence to promote the widespread applications of intelligent systems. 

During my bachelor period, I conducted research on Passive Assisted Exoskeleton and constructed the functional prototype under the supervision of [Prof. Hongqiang Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wanghq/en/). In addition, I collaborated closely with [Dr. Jianwen Luo](https://sites.google.com/view/jianwen-luo/home) from [AIRS](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en), focusing on the mechanical design of Quadruped Robots.

Currently, my research interests lie in robot perception and planning, especially the intersection area of robotic navigation and cutting-edge machine learning. During my graduate period, I worked on the motion planning of industrial robots at [ROKAE Robotics](https://www.rokae.com/?l=en-us) in summer 2021. Since February 2022, I have been engaged as a computer vision engineer at [Lely Technologies](https://www.lely.com/nl/), focusing on developing algorithm for real-time multi-camera image stitching. In July 2022, I started my master thesis about active visual SLAM supervised by [Elia Bonetto](https://eliabntt.github.io/#/) and [Dr. Aamir Ahmad](https://www.aamirahmad.de/) at the Flight Robotics and Perception Group (FRPG) of [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/), Tübingen.
